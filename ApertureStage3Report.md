### The Vision

**Aperture** is a photo sharing application set in a fun, competitive and educational environment. 

By allowing users to create and enter photography challenges and gain points on their posts, aperture succeeds at giving users a unique gaming experience with players guaranteed a multitude of options to win challenges, badges and collect profile points.

Aperture allows users to share, comment and provide constructive feedback on posts in hopes of building an active, fun, encouraging and ever growing community of photography enthusiasts, hobbyists, professionals, gamers and anyone else who may be curious.

Every user's user experience, suggestions and privacy is important to us. Aperture enables users to report any content that they deem inappropriate or bugs that they discover to app managers. All application users shall follow a strict "no human in image" policy in adherence to our efforts at keeping this platform unbiased, focused on user contribution and free from legal hap hassle.

<span style="color:blue">*MORE ...*</span>



##### 1.2. High level Components

1. **User Account System**

   This component handles user signup/login, profile creation/deletion/management and validation of user details. This component ensures that users submit consent forms in order to upload a photo of themselves as their profile picture or alternatively choose from pre-defined avatar pictures instead. 

2. **Content Creation System**

   This component focusses on enabling users to create/destroy content on the application. Users may create posts (comprising of images - via image upload/taken using camera, associated GPS data and text), channels, collections, challenges and a portfolio. Users may delete any content that they have created. Features supported include modification of images during upload, tagging of objects/public events in images and sharing of content (on feedback/gaming forums, profile, collections, channels, challenges and portfolio).

3. **User Interaction System**

   This component enables interaction among users and/or application managers. Facilitated features include a chat between users, rating of posts, point (profile/challenge points) tracking, adding/deletion of comments, sending/accepting/ignoring friend requests, blocking/unblocking of users, following/unfollowing of channels, a feedback forum, a gaming forum, search/explore facility, news feed fetching, leaderboard management, participation in challenges, notification handling, user content/bug/help reporting management and making recommendations.
